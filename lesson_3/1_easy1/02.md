`!` or `?` at the end of a method, is part of the method name. Not Ruby syntax. Depending on the particular implementation of the method, will depict what the method is really doing.

`!` is the not operator
`?` usually signifies the value will be a boolean
`?` is used in ternary operations along with `:`


1. `!=` is the not equal operator used in equality.
2. `!` before something like `!user_name` is used to turn object into their boolean equivilant.
3. `!` after something like `words.uniq!` signifies that the `#uniq!` method is destructive and will mutate the caller.That is only part of the method name, it doesn't do anything.
4. Putting a `?` before something in a ternary operation would mean the operation directly on the right of it would be executed if the conditional evaluated to `true`

5. Putting a `?` after something usually signifies that the value will be a boolean. It is also put to the right of the conditional statement in ternary operations.
